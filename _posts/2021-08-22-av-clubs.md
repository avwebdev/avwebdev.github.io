During the last school year (2020-2021) which was virtual, AV Web's officers noticed that club participation across Amador's clubs had significantly dropped. By surveying students, we found the root cause of this problem: a lack of knowledge about the dozens of diverse clubs at Amador. To fix this problem, we created a website which serves as a centralized hub for all information related to clubs at Amador. Within a few weeks of launch, clubs reported higher rates of participation and an uptick in the number of new members.

We built the website with [JavaScript](/tags#JavaScript), [Node.js](/tags#Node.js), [Express.js](/tags#Express.js), [HTML](/tags#HTML), [CSS](/tags#CSS), and [Google Cloud](/tags#Google%20Cloud). We also created a CI/CD pipeline with [GitHub Actions](/tags/#GitHub%20Actions) for automated tests, builds, and deploys. [**Check out the website!**](https://clubs.amadorweb.org/)
