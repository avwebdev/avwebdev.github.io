Donversity is a website created to celebrate Amador Valley High School's diversity in a virtual format. Amador generally has a Donversity rally every year, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was not possible in 2021. Within a few weeks, AV Web's officers bootstrapped a functional and responsive website to ensure that Amador students could still celebrate Amador's diversity despite not being in-person.

We built the website with [React](/tags#React), [TypeScript](/tags#TypeScript), and [Firebase](/tags#Firebase). We also created a CI/CD pipeline with [GitHub Actions](/tags/#GitHub%20Actions) for automated tests, builds, and deploys. [**Check out the website!**](https://donversity.amadorweb.org/)
